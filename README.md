🚀 PROJECTS – Personal Development Portfolio

Welcome to my PROJECTS repository!  
This is the central hub for all the software projects I build as I learn, experiment, and grow as a developer.  
Each project is organized in its own folder with complete source code and documentation.

This repository will gradually expand to include:
- 💡 Learning-based practice projects  
- 🧪 Concept-based virtual labs  
- 💻 Language-specific builds (C, Python, Java, etc.)  
- ⚙ Console applications & utilities  
- 🎯 DSA, algorithms, and problem-solving collections  

📂 Current Project

1️⃣ C Concept Virtual Lab Console
A complete interactive learning module designed to help beginners understand C fundamentals using a structured, menu-driven virtual lab.

✔ Covers:  
- Data types, operators, loops  
- Arrays, strings, pointers  
- Functions & modular programming  
- Memory concepts  
- Pattern printing  
- Error-free input handling  
- Example-driven learning  

📁 Folder: `C_Concept_Virtual_Lab_Console/`  
Each module contains explanations, examples, and clean C code.

(More projects will be added soon.)

🧰 Tech Stack (Will Grow Over Time)
This repository may include projects using:
- C (primary for now)
- Python
- Java
- SQL
- HTML/CSS/JS
- Tools: VS Code, gcc, Git, GitHub

🎯 Purpose of This Repository
- To track my learning journey
