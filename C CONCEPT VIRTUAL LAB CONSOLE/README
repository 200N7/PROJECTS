🧪 C Concept Virtual Lab Console
A fully interactive, menu-driven Virtual Lab designed to help beginners understand and practice core C programming concepts.  
This project simulates a learning environment where users can explore topics, run examples, and view explanations directly in the console.

📘 Overview
The C Concept Virtual Lab Console is a structured, educational tool built in pure C.  
It breaks down complex topics into simple, guided modules and provides hands-on learning through:

- Menu-driven navigation  
- Example-based demonstrations  
- Pattern printing exercises  
- Pointer & memory exploration  
- String and array manipulation  
- Beginner-friendly explanations  

This project is ideal for students, beginners, and anyone preparing for programming interviews.

🎯 Features

✔ 1. Basic Concepts Explorer
Learn the foundations of C:
- Data types  
- Variables  
- Operators  
- Input/Output  
- Loops & conditional statements  

✔ 2. Arrays & Strings Lab
Practical demonstrations of:
- 1D & 2D arrays  
- Character arrays  
- String functions (strlen, strcmp, strcpy, strcat, etc.)  
- Safe input handling using `fgets()`  

✔ 3. Pointer Playground
Understand pointers visually:
- Pointer declaration  
- Pointer arithmetic  
- Double pointers  
- Address tracing (`&`, `*`, `**`)  

✔ 4. Functions & Modular Programming
Shows:
- Function prototypes  
- Call-by-value behavior  
- Modular file structure  
- Explanation of global vs local declarations  

✔ 5. Pattern Printing Lab
Interactive pattern builder including:
- Stars  
- Numbers  
- Shapes  
- Logic behind loops (inner/outer loop explanation)

✔ 6. Utility Tools Included
- Min/Max finder  
- Temperature converter  
- Basic calculator logic  
- Storage size viewer using `sizeof()`

✔ 7. Clean User Interface
- Menu-driven structure  
- Error-handled inputs  
- Smooth looping using `while(1)`  
- Exit using `exit(0)`  

🛠 Tech Stack

📚 Learning Outcomes
By using this virtual lab, a learner will understand:
- How memory works in C  
- How pointers reference values  
- How loops generate patterns  
- How arrays & strings behave  
- How functions are declared & executed  
- Why `fgets()` is safer than `scanf("%s")`  
- Why infinite `while(1)` loops work  
- How modular C projects are organized  

🔮 Future Enhancements
- Add more patterns  
- Add DSA module (arrays, search, sort)  
- Add file-handling lab  
- Add pointer visualization diagram  
- Add debugging examples
